## Myspace

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm an engineering manager at [CarGurus](https://github.com/cargurus). I was inspired to start coding when I realized profiles on Myspace could be themed with css and HTML. I spent quite a few years writing C# and I made some cool open sourced projects for C#. Like everyone who gets old, I now spend a lot more time focusing on my career, my life, and my mental health. Recently my team at CarGurus have been building some [webpack plugins in rust](https://github.com/cargurus/webpack-hash-cache). I mostly [blog](https://terrible.dev/) about web performance. My big passions include performance tuning, Functional Programming, Infrastructure as Code, and anything web related.
